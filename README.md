# Dan Murphy's Caesar Cipher - For the lovely people at **DrugDev**
![Julius Caesar](http://fearlessmen.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Emperor-Julius-Caesar.jpg)

## The exercise

> *Write code, in your choice of language, that takes as input a string and integer shift and returns that string encoded using a basic Caesar cipher.*

## Instructions

First you'll need Node.js:
* You can do a manual install from here: `https://nodejs.org/en/`. This will include Node and its package manager, `npm`.
* If you are on a Mac and using Homebrew you can do the following:
  + `brew install node --without-npm` (`npm` and Homebrew don't play well together)
  + `curl -L https://www.npmjs.com/install.sh | sh` (so, install `npm` separately)
* Or if you fancy a version manager download`nvm`: `https://github.com/creationix/nvm`

Once you've got Node installed:
* `git clone git@github.com:Murphydbuffalo/caesar-cipher.git`
* `cd ./caesar-cipher`
* `npm install` to install dependencies
* `npm test` to run the test suite
* Check out `cipher.js` to see the code
* Check out the repo to see the git history: `https://github.com/Murphydbuffalo/caesar-cipher`
* Email Dan at `murphydbuffalo@gmail.com` with questions or comment :)
